-- App switcher
--
-- The app switcher uses a modal hotkey that, when pressed, gives access to
-- a configurable list of running applications by pressing one other key. 
-- This means you can switch to another application in 2 key presses.
--
-- Why? I like spaces for some apps, like IntelliJ IDEA, Ulyssses and OmniFocus.
-- But when you're looking at one, where's the other you need? To the left? To
-- the right? I typically don't remember, so I use âŒ˜+Tab. But that more often
-- than not requires multiple key presses to get to the app I need.
--
-- Alfred helps, but not enough: Launch Alfred, type at least 1 character, press
-- Enter. That's 3 key presses. At least. With this app switcher, it's always 2.
--
-- The app switcher doesn't launch applications when they're not running, on
-- purpose. I find I like it better to be told that an app is not running, than
-- that it's being launched if that happens to be the case. Some applications
-- take quite some time to startup, like IntelliJ. Your mileage may vary..
